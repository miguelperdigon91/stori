# Stori Tech Challenge

It is Stori's chanllege as part of its intervias process. It was developed by Miguel Perdig√≥n using Python 3.8 language and Psotgres database. The program loads the data coming from the transactions.cvs file into the database and then processes it to make a summary report that arrives in the mail.

## Configuration
The first thing to do is to set the environment variables that are defined in the docker-compose

- POSTGRES_USER: it is optional to modify it, you can leave it as it is by default, but if you change it, it must be the same in both db and app.
- POSTGRES_PASSWORD: it is optional to modify it, you can leave it as it is by default, but if you change it, it must be the same in both db and app.
- GMAIL_PASSWORD: contact the developer for the password miguelperdigon91@gmail.com
- EMAIL_TARGET: is the e-mail address where you will receive the result of the program execution.

## Use
Once the environment variables have been configured, you must open a terminal and move the current file to the program folder and then execute the following docker command 
```
sudo docker-compose up
```

To view the records that are stored in the database go to the browser and enter the following in the browser
```commandline
http://localhost:5050/browser/
```
The username and password are defined in the environment variables PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL and PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD

Once inside, you create a new connection to a database, which must be called as defined in POSTGRES_DB. the host you put 'db' and complete the other fields with whatever is defined in the environment variables POSTGRES_USER and POSTGRES_PASSWORD.
